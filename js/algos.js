write a function that takes an array of words or phrases 
and returns the longest word or phrase in the array. 
So if we gave your function the array of 
["long phrase","longest phrase","longer phrase"], 
it would return "longest phrase". This is a logical 
reasoning challenge, so try to reason through this based 
on what you already know, rather than Googling the fanciest 
solution or looking up built-in sorting functions. 
Note that "some string".length will do what you expect in JS.


// input: array of words  
	// hint: use .length
	// steps: compare two words by their lengths
	// delete the word that is short
	// loop through array until length of array = 1
	// then print on console the array in string form
// output: returns the longest word in the array

function biggestWord(word_array_input){




} // function


biggestWord([["long","longest","longer"]]) // expected output "longest"
