<!-- 
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	It creates a cleaner and more easily legible way to read code. It is also a way for the original author to communicate to both browser and other developers looking at the code because semantic tags have a defined content to be included. I think <article></article> is quite useful because most websites have text content and it will be clearly defined with a header as well.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	The browser will read from the line 1 and onwards. HTML semantics also helps the browser identify various sections and parts of the code.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	I learned that I can create and customize snippets to save time and to be more efficient. I also learned from a side comment from Bison that Sublime can autosave. I think that I will want to update my current HTML snippet because it only gives me <html></html>. I may also want to go back and update my html5 snippet to include more HTML5 semantic tags.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? 
	Understanding the little nuances of each HTML5 semantic element was a bit more difficult but with trial and error, and with the help of the validator, I was able to see what elements I was missing. By practicing and putting code through the validator, I hope to be able to master the HTML5 elements and nuances.
